## Description

Manage `/etc/resolv.conf` on AIX, Solaris, RHEL, Debian and FreeBSD with Puppet.

## Setup

### What resolve_conf affects
* Manages the `/etc/resolv.conf` file
* Restarts the `dns/client` on Solaris if the file is changed

## Usage

### Basic

```puppet
include resolv_conf
```

Use Google DNS

### Customised

```puppet
class { "resolv_conf":
  search      => "megacorp.com",
  nameservers => ["10.0.0.1", "10.0.4.4"],
}
```

Set a search domain and use specific nameservers.
